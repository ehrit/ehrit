Hi there! My name is Chris. I'm a proud father and a system engineer with ~10 years of experience in that profession, though, I am working, playing, and learning with computers for my whole life. 
I specialize in designing and implementing efficient and scalable solutions for complex systems. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
As I want to improve my coding skills and hardly have any experience with git, I started to use Github more frequently (and it was also a part of John Savill's video course...). 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops?view=azure-devops) to tackle the [AZ-400 exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-400)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m banging my head on defeating Demon of Hatred in Sekiro

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a professional.
